Notes

I don’t chase trends.
I chase understanding.

I build systems that are expected to:
- fail gracefully
- explain themselves
- be maintained by humans, not heroes

My years in GIS taught me that context matters.
A system without context is just noise.

Current State

- building backend & spatial systems
- balancing delivery and correctness
- learning to remove more than I add
